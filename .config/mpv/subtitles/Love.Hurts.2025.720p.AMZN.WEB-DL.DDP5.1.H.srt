<i>The thing I love most
about Valentine's Day</i>

00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,365

of the unexpected,</i>

00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,412
<i>that something
magical could happen</i>

4
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:09,112
<i>and maybe that special someone
will come back into your life</i>

5
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:12,028
<i>and change its course
for the better.</i>

00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,095
Ash, it's Marv.

60
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,445
I just got to the
Emerald Springs house.

61
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,274
Someone drew a Hitler
mustache on my yard sign.

62
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,797
Hitler!

63
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,712
- Can you believe that?
- Have some dignity.

64
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,672
It's got to be Jeff Zaks at
Peak Point messing with me.

65
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,282
I have half a mind
to go over there...

66
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,153
And do what, Marv?

67
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,329
Cook him dinner?

68
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,331
The guy has, like, a black belt.

69
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,855
He could crush you
with his thumb.

70
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,160
Eh.

71
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:09,727
Anything going on at the office?

72
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,208
Only the office
Valentine's Day party.

73
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,775
If one streamer
falls on my desk,

74
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,274
I will stuff it so
far up your asshole

75
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,952
you will be shitting hearts.

76
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,737
I will murder you.

77
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,739
Wow. Someone's in a good mood.

78
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,612
I really... I don't think I
can do this anymore, Marv.

79
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,744
- Do what anymore?
- All of it, you know?

80
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:28,529
Work. Live.

81
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,053
It's so fucking bleak.

82
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,229
You know, and I
feel, I feel sick.

83
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,406
You're not sick, Ash.
You're depressed.

84
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,670
I get it.

85
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,020
It's very natural to feel
lonely on Valentine's Day.

86
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,674
Look.

87
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,764
Every day is an opportunity
to change your life.

88
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,940
If you're not happy,
do something about it.

89
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,464
I really don't need

90
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,876
a bumper sticker right
now, Marv, please.

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,031
I'm serious.

92
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,685
You've got a chef's kitchen,

93
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,731
top-of-the-line appliances,

94
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:00,517
a beautiful space for those
big family breakfasts.

95
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:08,046
You know, I remember the
feeling when I bought my home.

96
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,224
It was like, for the
first time in my life,

97
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:15,532
something was truly all mine.

98
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,491
There's a freedom
in that, you know?

99
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,058
Even if it's just
a little taste.

100
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,539
You want to know my
favorite part about my job?

101
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,020
I get to relive that experience,

102
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:28,371
that first feeling of
freedom, again and again,

103
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,155
through good folks
like yourselves.

104
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,463
It's why I want a home for you.

105
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,206
It's simple.

106
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,165
I pour everything into it
because it's meaningful.

107
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:43,821
And because it's
meaningful, I have meaning.

108
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:48,043
<i>If you find something
you love, go after it.</i>

109
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,132
What do you love, Marv?

110
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,616
The job, of course.

111
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,921
Oh, God, that's sad.

112
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,968
- Cookie?
- No.

113
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:05,321
Ash, I'm your boss, which
means you have to listen to me.

114
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,931
Hey, Deborah, cookie?

115
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,498
Oh, I'd love a
cookie. Thanks, Marv.

116
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,065
- Toby, hey! Great to see you.
- Hey.

117
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,806
- Cookie?
- Ah, cookie alert.

118
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:12,870
Hi, Jenny.
-JENNY: Thanks, Marv. These are delicious.

119
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,286
Okay, speaking about bosses,

120
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,071
Cliff came by looking
for you earlier.

121
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,507
Yeah? He say why?

122
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,291
No, he's in a meeting.
Back in a while.

123
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,313
- Hi. Good morning. Cookie?
- Cookies again? Thank you, Marv.

124
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:25,559
Well, uh, so the Reebers called
about the Emerald Springs house.

125
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:26,995
They're such freaks.

126
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,518
But they want to
take a look at it.

127
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,519
Great. Schedule it.

128
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,042
After today's open house,

129
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,957
I think it's gonna be competitive.
-Yeah.

130
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,179
Looks like someone's
got a secret admirer.

131
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,880
Who's it from?

132
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,276
Marv, you all right?

133
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,410
Uh...

134
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,455
Not feeling great
all of a sudden.

135
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,677
- Um...
- I-I just need a minute.

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,852
Yeah.

137
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,723
Don't forget the office party.

138
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,344
"The animal breathes again.

139
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,740
"And for once, I'm
glad to see these bars.

140
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,918
"These bars that
keep me from myself.

141
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,443
"That keep me from you.

142
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,796
"I pass you rocks,
you tip the scales.

143
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,713
You grind me salt,
I cut your nails."

144
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,367
Raven?

145
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,155
What did you think
of that last stanza?

146
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,418
What?

147
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,202
The last stanza.

148
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:45,726
Was the imagery too obtuse?

149
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,163
I-I think you can do better.

150
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,039
Your brother Knuckles
wants to know

151
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,738
why Rose is spreading
love on Valentine's Day.

152
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,958
He wants to see her.

153
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,786
Where is she?

154
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,049
I have no idea.

155
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,965
I'm told you watched her
draw her last breath.

156
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,054
And yet...

157
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,448
she breathes again.

158
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,060
I told you, I don't know.

159
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:24,199
Your coworkers don't know
who you really are, do they?

160
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,118
And I'm willing to keep
your dirty little secret

161
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:33,817
if you tell me exactly
what I want to know.

162

I know you have, um, too.

Goddamn, son, you
have looked better.

189
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,298
Come on in my office.
I want to talk at you.

190
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,760
You have won the Regional
Realtor of the Year!

191
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,197
You did it!

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,894
Congratulations.

193
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,524
I wanted to come down
and tell you myself.

194
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,047
I know how hard you've
been busting your tail.

195
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,682
Cliff.

196
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,337
Man, you come a long way.

197
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,730
Proud of you.

198
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,865
Uh... thank you.

199
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,736
This is, um...

200
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,044
This means a lot to me.

201
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,829
I'm overwhelmed.

202
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,226
When we first met,
you were a man adrift.

203
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,054
Now look at you.

204
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:51,014
I mean, you just keep
getting after it.

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,455
Marvin?

206
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:01,068
Sorry. Uh...

207
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,200
Can I borrow your car?

208
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,985
My bike, it-it's not working.

209
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,728
Hell, sure.

210
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,120
It's yours.

211
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,170
Whoa! We're hugging.

212
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,389
We're hugging.

213
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,262
You've taught me so much, Cliff.
I just want you to know that.

214
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,525
You've been a great mentor.

215
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:29,226
You changed my life.

216
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,710
Marvin, you can't change a man
who doesn't want to be changed.

217
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,976
I'll grab the car later.

218
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,850
"Crazy for you," my ass.

219
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,895
Man, what got your
panties in a bunch?

220
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,290
Is-is he ever gonna
move? Been there all day.

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,293
Man, how wifey doing?

222
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,078
What y'all got planned
for, uh, Valentine's Day?

223
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,560
She, um, kicked me out again.

224
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,344
Man, get the fuck off the block.

225
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,606
- Is you serious?
- Yeah.

226
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,130
Damn.

227
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:06,698
She said that I'm
emotionally constipated.

228
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,637
"Love bug."

229
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,267
That's what she used
to call me, all right?

230
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,423
Yeah, whatever.

231
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,381
Fucking love bug.

232
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,993
Look, maybe you should call her

233
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,996
and apologize for being so...

234
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,128
being so constipated, you know?

235
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,567
Yeah, maybe you should, maybe
you should eat my whole ass.

236
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,971
Maybe I should beat
your whole ass.

237
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,285
Yeah, maybe you
should try to do that.

238
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,963
- You know...
- What, motherfucker?

239
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,071
That's... that's what I
might fucking actually do.

240
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,313
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

241
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,706
Is that him?

242
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,544
What?
-KING: Ay-yo, Merlo.

243
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,851
That boy Gable on
the move finally.

244
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,765
Well, that's weird, man.

245
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,203
He's probably going
to meet up with Rose.

246
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,552
All right?

247
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:20,250
Follow him and
find fucking Rose.

248
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,036
And you know what to do.

249
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,994
I'll keep Knuckles in the dark.

250
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,909
Fucking valentines!

251
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,215
Knuckles?

252
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,913
Am I interrupting, sir?

253
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,308
The Raven's not
answering his phone.

254
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,918
The Raven?

255
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,051
Wait, i-is this about
the valentines cards?

256
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,139
Yes.

257
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,271
It's Rose's handwriting, okay?

258
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,882
That I know.

259
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,101
About fucking time.

260
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,977
That's why I sent The Raven.

261
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,197
I thought we agreed to handle
the Rose situation in-house.

262
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,286
- Mmm.
- So why hire The Raven, too?

263
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,420
Now, the money that she
stole has been recovered.

264
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:02,466
She was a hell of a lawyer
for the organization.

265
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,295
Now she's just a-a loose end.

266
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,645
And we sure as hell
don't need The Raven...

267
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,623
If she's alive and back, she
could fuck everything up.

268
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,432
She knows whose money
that really was.

269
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,697
She's fucking with us right now.

270
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,134
All these goddamn
valentine cards.

271
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,919
Her idea of a game.

272
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,706
I need to find out why
Marvin didn't kill her

273
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,926
and decide if I'm
gonna kill her again.

274
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,971
Decide?

275
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,889
I mean, she stole from you.

276
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,718
We shouldn't hesitate
to kill her on sight.

277
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,024
Enough!

278
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,679
I said I want her alive.

279
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,618
Happy motherfucking
Valentine's Day.

280
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,836
Looks like love is...

281
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,887
Marvin Gable.

282
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:01,933
Yeah.

283
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,462
- Who are you?
- That's King, and I'm Otis.

284
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,596
Yeah, we work with your brother

285
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,511
and his right-hand
man, Renny Merlo.

286
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:19,473
They brought us in after your
little, uh, career change.

287
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:23,259
Damn, I thought your ass would
be a little more scarier.

288
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,870
But look, your place
here, it inspires me.

289
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:29,483
If a has-been killer like
yourself can, you know,

290
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:32,834
score a sweet little
civilian life like this,

291
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:36,229
maybe there's hope for me and O.

292
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,032
What you think? You
think I got a shot at it?

293
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,277
Anything's possible.

294
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,149
- How's your credit?
- My credit? Hmm?

295
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,979
Ha ha, ha ha.

296
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:49,633
- A little funny guy, huh?
- Fun.

297
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,901
Now, look, you bleeding

298
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,729
just a little bit too much

299
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,905
for a motherfucker who
don't know nothing.

300
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,189
And I think that you've
packed a little too much

301
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,649
for a guy who
isn't running away.

302
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,521
- Mm. Where you going, my boy?
- Okay?

303
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,697
Time to listen, little man.

304
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,307
- Listen!
- Listen, motherfucker.

305
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,004
- Yeah.
- Listen.

306
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,093
Where is Rose?

307
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,877
I don't know.

308
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,487
Come on, now.

309
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,411
You should've just told
us what we need to know.

310
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:22,449
Where is Rose, and why
did you not kill her?

311
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,192
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

312
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,691
What are you doing?
I just opened that.

313
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,673
So what? It's fucking soda.

314
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,347
You-you trippin'. Fuck,
I thought we could share.

315
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,721
- C-Could you ask?
- Fuck, O, please forgive me.

316
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,157
Of course we can share.

317
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,249
Fuck!

318
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,341
Fuck that!

319
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,473
I'm on him.

320
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,040
I got it. I got it.

321
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,477
Get your ass over here.

322
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,783
- Yeah!
- Yeah, come here!

323
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,743
Damn, O!

324
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,485
Watch this, watch this.

325
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,923
Motherfucker!

326
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,968
- Tag team!
- Ah, no.

327
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,692
Your turn, your turn,
your turn, your turn.

328
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,065
Get him, O! Get him, O!

329
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,733
Fuck! Why?!

330
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,178
- Come here.
- Fuck him up, O.

331
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,706
Oh, shit!

332
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,888
Where you think you're
going? Oh, fuck!

333
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,237
What the fuck?!

334
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,242
- Motherfucker!
- Get the fuck in the fridge!

335
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,026
- Get your ass in there.
- Damn!

336
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,857
Bye!

337
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,559
Watch this, O. Watch this, O.

338
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,388
Shit, I missed!

339
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,264
Get him, O! Fuck him up!

340
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,657
Come on, come on.

341
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,271
Ooh, shit! Oh!

342
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,100
Okay. Okay.

343
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,993
Yeah. Don't think you're
so fucking cool now...

344
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,133
Hey! Where Rose at,
you little fuck?!

345
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,137
What...

346
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,095
Hey, that could've
been your head.

347
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,749
Tell my brother to back off.

348
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,621
I'm not telling
your brother shit!

349
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,492
You know what? I'm-a
kill your little ass.

350
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,062
What the...

351
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,893
How the fuck can I get this?

352
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,938
It's really stuck.

353
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,727
This little motherfucking
spider monkey ninja.

354
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,902
God!

355
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,613
Hey, Marv.

356
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,137
Rose?

357
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,965
Hey!

358
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,880
What the fuck is you...

359
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,498
See you tomorrow.

360
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,668
Hello?

361
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:47,931
Hey.

362
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:52,849
Do you happen to have an
appointment with Mr. Gable?

363
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,038
Mr. Knuckle. I am
not answering that.

364
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,960
<i>"My blades are quiet,
sharp and clean.</i>

365
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,702
<i>"They cut through life unseen.</i>

366
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,401
<i>"No echo follows,
no scream, no cry.</i>

367
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,838
<i>Just steel and
flesh as I pass by."</i>

368
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,768
Did you find her?

369
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,354
Man, we just got the
shit beat out of us.

370
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:45,685
- Marvin and Rose got away.
- Fuck!

371
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,647
This is so fucked up. Seriously.
-Fuck!

372
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,736
This motherfucker just
a little bit too crazy,

373
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,564
and me and O ain't
sign up for this shit.

374
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,045
K-King, listen to me
very carefully. Okay?

375
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:01,135
If she is taken alive, she
will tell Knuckles everything,

376
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,877
that Kippy fixed the books
and I stole the fucking money,

377
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,444
and we're all dead.

378
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,010
You guys are idiots.

379
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:10,187
I will find Rose myself
and fucking kill her.

380
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,320
And I'll text you the address

381
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,453
so you can clean up
what is left of her.

382
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,150
Okay? Oh.

383
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,631
And find Kippy, okay?

384
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,676
I mean, he hasn't been
returning my calls,

385
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,852
and that bastard
knows everything.

386
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,725
- And the fucker talks too much.
- All right, man. Fuck.

387
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:28,858
You all right, my boy?

388
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,425
No.

389
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,849
What am I wearing?

390
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,851
Hi! You've reached Marvin Gable

391
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,679
at Frontier Realty.

392
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:09,246
So sorry I missed your
call, but leave a message

393
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,553
and I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.

394
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,163
I want a home for you.

395
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,558
Hey. It's...

396
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,474
It's me. Um...

397
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,567
There's a dead poet
in your office.

398
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:28,483
Maybe you know that.

399
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,572
Maybe you don't.

400
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,269
Very funny, Rose.

401
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:45,326
I need you to hear
one of his poems.

402
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:48,111
It's called...

403
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:49,809
"The Dancing Bear."

404
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,076
"My dancing bear,

405
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,122
"sometimes prancing bear.

406
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,604
<i>"So silent, so graceful.</i>

407
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,389
<i>"Do you have any wisdom for me,</i>

408
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:09,393
<i>"as you sway so charmingly</i>

409
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:12,092
<i>"inside your cage?</i>

410
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:15,922
<i>"Upon your stage, you move.</i>

411
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,620
<i>"Out here, the chains are thick.</i>

412
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:22,668
<i>"Out here, the
ringmaster's sick.</i>

413
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:27,020
<i>Those gray bars in your way
are so ill-fitting, so..."</i>

414
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,240
<i>I always had a sense</i>

415
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:32,547
<i>that Rose might
try to come back.</i>

416
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,986
<i>She had the guts to
stand up to anyone.</i>

417
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,468
<i>Even my brother Knuckles.</i>

418
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,386
<i>He tried to kill her once.</i>

419
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,041
<i>But I interfered
because I love her.</i>

420
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:54,177
<i>Even though she would never
look twice at a guy like me.</i>

421
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:00,575
<i>Oh. He does look
cute in that sweater.</i>

422
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,098
<i>I mean, look at him.</i>

423
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,362
<i>He's kind, he's
smart, he is a badass.</i>

424
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:11,673
<i>But he has to face his past
so we can get our lives back.</i>

425
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,461
Consider this my
resignation, Marv.

426
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,769
I just can't dance anymore.

427
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,398
No one's ever...

428
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,274
...understood my words before.

429
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,798
Oh.

430
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,020
No one's words

431
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:58,502
have ever understood
me... before.

432
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,550
Hey, Andi, you got the bar?

433
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,162
Aw.

434
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:12,560
Well, I really hate
that you shaved.

435
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,780
You were the one...

436
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,347
The glasses are a nice touch.

437
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,827
Very Clark Kent.

438
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,881
I got you out.

439
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,578
What do you want, Rose?

440
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:34,190
A secured outcome
no matter the cost.

441
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,063
Exactly what outcome?

442
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,413
I want my life back, and
I need you to help me.

443
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,502
That's all.

444
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,505
Your life back? Why now?

445
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,203
Well, why not? It's
Valentine's Day.

446
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,945
I sent the whole gang
these cute little cards.

447
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,642
I learned calligraphy
and everything.

448
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,255
Do you think this is a joke?

449
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,473
We're in danger.

450
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,953
Okay, relax.

451
00:28:57,997 --> 00:29:01,087
This isn't Knuckles' territory.

452
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,959
You are safe. We are safe.

453
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,309
We're not safe anywhere.

454
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,659
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

455
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,705
You need to run. Tonight.

456
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,012
Oh, because that's how you
deal with Knuckles, right?

457
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,230
"Running away."

458
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,105
I know exactly what I've done.

459
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:22,586
And I know exactly
what I'm doing.

460
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,806
Goodbye, Rose.

461
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,895
Marvin, this is it.

462
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:32,335
It's now... or never.

463
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,164
And I need your help.

464
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,080
Hey, hey, hey. I know you.

465
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:39,212
- Excuse me.
- No, it's you.

466
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,652
Your ads, man.

467
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,219
Your fucking bench ads.

468
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,979
I see your face everywhere I go!
-I'm so sorry.

469
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,024
What the fuck are you doing?
-Sorry, everyone.

470
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,745
I'll give you a ride.

471
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,878
Uh, Andi, can you
give Reggie some ice?

472
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:03,062
I was pleasantly surprised
to find this in your pocket.

473
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,935
Amethyst.

474
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,198
One of the best protections
against nightmares.

475
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,374
I'm the one who gave it to you.

476
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:12,985
Why'd you keep it?

477
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,552
I'm the sentimental type.

478
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,511
I know.

479
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,252
I love that about you.

480
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:27,086
Come on. Let's go.

481
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,760
What was that?

482
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,980
What? You are being paranoid.

483
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,552
You saved my award.

484
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:03,513
Well, yeah. I could barely
pry it out of your hands.

485
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,950
Slow down, could you?

486
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,517
Well, the Marvin I
know likes to go fast.

487
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,524
Oops.

488
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,616
- Rose?
- Mm-hmm?

489
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,096
What the heck are you doing?

490
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,011
I want to see the
real you, right now.

491
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,318
This is the real me.
The other guy's gone.

492
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,320
I buried him out in
the quarry with you.

493
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,365
No, no, no. I saw you
in the bar, babes.

494
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:30,889
You wanted to hurt that guy.

495
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,022
Marvin, come out!

496
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,044
- Please stop! Please stop!
- Come out wherever you are!

497
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,113
Fucking stop!

498
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:52,823

531
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,516
You're cute.

532
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,739
There are rooms upstairs
if you're tired.

533
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,225
What's your whole deal
with this thing anyway?

534
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,577
After I left Knuckles,

535
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,015
I honestly didn't think
I could be normal.

536
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,712
This proves I can.

537
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:28,631
I've changed, Rose.

538
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,329
Mm.

539
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:31,939
No, you haven't.

540
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:34,376
You're just hiding.

541
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,031
What are you doing,
Rose? Are you crazy?

542
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,555
I didn't come here to hide.

543
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,254
Hey, I worked hard
to get to where I am.

544
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,518
And because of you, I lost
everything in one day.

545
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,998
Oh, I know exactly how
that feels, Marvin.

546
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,957
Exactly.

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,526
Why couldn't you
just stay dead, Rose?

548
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:56,006
Because it's humiliating.

549
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,400
No name, no truth.

550
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:59,619
You got nothing.

551
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:00,968
You're nobody.

552
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,796
I'm nobody.

553
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,278
Hiding ain't living.

554
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:11,326
But if you want to
live to see next week,

555
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,809
you'll run far away and
never show your face again.

556
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,855
Well, I already did that.

557
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:22,032
Now I'm trying
something different.

558
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:26,298
How far would you go
to get your life back?

559
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,346
I already did.

560
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,088
Follow me. I got to
show you something.

561
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,554
"Look in the mirror, fuckface."

562
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,614
Kippy.

563
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:23,703
Why is Knuckles'
accountant in your trunk?

564
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,009
It's all part of the plan.

565
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,577
And where is his finger?

566
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,626
Marvin, you are not listening.

567
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,367
I told you I want my life back,

568
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,020
and I'll do what
it fucking takes.

569
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,848
Cutting off his finger, Rose?

570
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:40,783
Do you realize what a
dangerous game you're playing?

571
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,330
Look, I needed a fingerprint.

572
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,120
Yes, I know.

573
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:54,995
Look at that.

574
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,258
It's his dental caps.

575
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,042
I'll be needing those back.

576
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,002
Hello, Marv.

577
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,091
All right.

578
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,094
Now I want to know
what you and Merlo got

579
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,314
out of setting me up.

580
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:13,361
Three years ago, I helped Merlo
steal four million dollars.

581
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,713
Of that sweet Russian money.

582
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:19,715
Money you...

583
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,458
...were going to hide
by cooking the books

584
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,678
so Knuckles would never miss it.

585
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:28,985
Which, by the way, he didn't,
because you fools put it

586
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:31,510
in the trunk of my
car for him to find.

587
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:36,776
Now, I'm a smart girl.

588
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,169
I can think of a few reasons

589
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,476
why you'd want me
out of the picture.

590
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,875
But why, why, why
risk being killed

591
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:52,879
stealing money from Knuckles
just to give it all back to him?

592
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,968
Now, that just

593
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,667
doesn't make sense.

594
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:01,409
That's easy.

595
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,455
We had no intention
of keeping the money.

596
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:07,197
Merlo wanted your position
as Knuckles' right hand.

597
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,503
Oh.

598
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,592
He was willing to risk it all,

599
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:14,248
and the two million dollars in
the, in the boot of your car,

600
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,468
well, that was enough to
put you six feet under.

601
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,951
You said "two million."

602
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,347
We stole four.

603
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:31,439
So, pray tell,
where's the other two?

604
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:37,053
Don't waste my time, Kippy. You
want to lose another finger?

605
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,490
Okay, okay.

606
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,274
Merlo has it.

607
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,103
He paid me for fixing the
books and took the rest.

608
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,149
Fucking Merlo.

609
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,935
He set me up.

610
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:51,633
Mm. Yeah, I think so, yeah.

611
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:55,898
Framed me and kept the other
two million for himself.

612
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:01,208
So, Marv.

613
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:07,432
You did drive me to a quarry
and leave me for dead.

614
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:25,145
<i>I made Knuckles a fortune</i>

615
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:26,427
<i>laundering money
from the Russians,</i>

616
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,409
<i>- but as you know, I wanted out.</i>
- Marvin?

617
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:32,065
Stealing money with Merlo
was never a good idea.

618
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,937
You don't have to do this.
We can still... Whoa!

619
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:36,983
<i>Of course that
motherfucker framed me.</i>

620
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,335
Rose Carlisle is dead.

621
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,163
Don't come back.

622
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,512
The rule of the company is:

623
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,427
If you steal from
Knuckles, you die.

624
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,867
<i>But you broke that rule.</i>

625
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,260
Marv.

626
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:55,131
<i>- And defied your brother.</i>
- No.

627
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,917
And I'm so grateful.

628
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,794
But I just got to ask:

629
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,970
Did you know they
were setting me up?

630
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,064
I didn't know, okay?

631
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,632
You didn't know?
You didn't know?!

632
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,983
I knew you were a thief,
I knew you were a liar,

633
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,681
and I knew my brother
wanted you dead.

634
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,814
Oh, so you just
volunteered for the job?

635
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,468
Yeah.

636
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,429
Listen.

637
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:35,868
If I didn't do it,
someone else would have.

638
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,132
You'd be gone.

639
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:44,137
And I knew if I took the job,

640
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,488
it was the only chance
I had to save you.

641
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:50,360
I didn't want to imagine
a world without you.

642
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,109
The Russians.

643
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,242
She knows it all.

644
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,244
Valentine's Day, right?

645
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,116
It's not my fucking day.

646
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,307
Motherfucker took a swing at me.

647
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,615
Yeah.

648
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,791
Uh, what the fuck is that?

649
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,489
Got it for Cindy
for Valentine's.

650
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:33,882
That's why we made
this fucking stop?

651
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,365
Bruh, it's simple.

652
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,716
Ain't no fake-ass,
made-in-Sri-Lanka teddy bear

653
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,676
gon' help you get your
fucking wife back.

654
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,896
Get your fucking mind
together, my boy.

655
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,637
Oh.

656
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:52,422
Give the motherfucker his
bear back, and let's go.

657
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:55,338
We got to go clean
up after Merlo.

658
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,136
Marvin?

659
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,181
What in the hell?

660
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,707
Marvin, you here?

661
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,057
I'm here to pick up the car.

662
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,102
Your front door's wide open.

663
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,891
Oh, uh...

664
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,160
Hi.

665
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:36,292
I'm Alvin.

666
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,512
My friends call me Knuckles.

667
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,079
Cliff Cussick. Howdy.

668
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,995
Ah. My brother's savior.

669
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,842
You're the one he spends
Thanksgiving with now, right?

670
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,215
Yeah.

671
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,609
Yeah, Marvin comes
over at Thanksgiving.

672
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:49,958
He's family.

673
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:51,022
I'm sorry. You
have to forgive me.

674
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:53,179
I'm a little, uh, surprised.

675
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:56,486
Marvin never mentioned
that he had a... brother.

676
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,358
Drink?

677
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,533
Oh.

678
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,493
You're not gonna have one?

679
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,105
I still got a little bit left.

680
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,889
No, thank you, kindly.

681
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,414
Where-where is he?

682
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,262
I mean, I haven't seen
Marvin since he left work,

683
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:14,524
and he wasn't looking too good.

684
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:17,333
- What a considerate boss.
- Yeah.

685
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:20,249
He's family, I told
you. He's my brother.

686
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:27,300
I got to be honest
with you, Cliff.

687
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:32,131
It hurts my feelings that
Marvin never mentioned me.

688
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:34,655
Oh, well, maybe he did.

689
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:36,352
My memory's not
like it used to be.

690
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:38,050
You want to feel better?

691
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,878
Marvin never told me
he played baseball.

692
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:43,229
Oh, I can assure you, Cliff,

693
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:46,058
there's a lot Marvin
didn't tell you.

694
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,756
<i>Rose is right.</i>

695
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,410
<i>I am hiding.</i>

696
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:02,988
<i>I allowed my brother to turn me</i>

697
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:05,686
<i>into someone I
never wanted to be.</i>

698
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,907
I could take you to at least a
dozen holes in the old quarry

699
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,386
that Marvin filled with bodies.

700
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,696
He was such a...

701
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,567
beautiful, beautiful monster.

702
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:23,095
But I controlled it.

703
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:26,141
He was obedient, did
what I said, always.

704
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,578
And when I unleashed him...

705
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,624
Oh.

706
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:35,847
I could take you
to the last hole.

707
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:40,329
But all you'd find is a hole.

708
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:43,463
'Cause apparently, he fell in
love and found a conscience.

709
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,336
Ever see her around?

710
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:50,513
No, sir, I don't believe I have.

711
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:53,255
You sure?

712
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:56,519
She seems like the kind of
woman a man would remember.

713
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,828
<i>I don't know if
Marvin understands</i>

714
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:03,396
<i>I'm here to save him.</i>

715
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,659
<i>Just like he saved me.</i>

716
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:11,360
<i>We have to face Knuckles
to be truly free, and...</i>

717
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:13,928
<i>I don't want to
do it without him.</i>

718
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,848
Goddamn, Alvin.

719
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:23,677
Those are some big words.

720
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:27,942
I got to be honest. I, uh...

721
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:30,945
I don't know that much about
the world you're talking about.

722
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,644
But I'm not naive enough to know

723
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,448
there's gonna be anything I
can say in this room right now

724
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:40,259
that's gonna change my fate.

725
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,261
I'll tell you what.

726
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,655
I believe in absolution.

727
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,659
I believe in second chances.

728
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:55,535
The difference between
putting bodies in holes

729
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:57,755
and families in homes...

730
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,409
...is pretty big.

731
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,064
Maybe too big.

732
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,720
<i>Knuckles only set me free</i>

733
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,549
<i>because I promised to kill Rose.</i>

734
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:15,947
<i>Now he will never
stop hunting us.</i>

735
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,212
<i>I know I have to face my
past to be truly free.</i>

736
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,739
<i>But goddamn it,</i>

737
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,437
<i>I love this new life.</i>

738
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:31,876
From the minute he started
selling homes for me,

739
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:35,009
he was working like he was
making up for something.

740
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,798
You know what?

741
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,843
Think I will take that drink.

742
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:56,596
And when push comes to shove,

743
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,207
Marvin's gonna be all right.

744
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:01,253
You're a wise man, Cliff.

745
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:04,604
But...

746
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:07,737
Marvin only has one brother.

747
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,803
Oh.

748
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,457
Morning, Marv.

749
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,678
- Painkillers.
- Oh.

750
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,029
Mm-hmm.

751
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:42,337
Oh, yeah.

752
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:44,035
I appreciate that.

753
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,732
I got to say,

754
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,735
a lot of intrigue with
this whole money situation.

755
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:50,519
Proper fucking quagmire.

756
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,274
Merlo and I thought
we were real smart

757
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,015
when we set up Rose
the way we did.

758
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:10,626
Knuckles still doesn't know

759
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,455
<i>we stole more than what
he found in Rose's trunk.</i>

760
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:14,935
<i>But you know the rule:</i>

761
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:18,373
<i>If you steal from
Knuckles, you die.</i>

762
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,769
Fuck me, man.

763
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:24,379
I would not like to be you

764
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:26,860
when your brother
finds out Rose is here.

765
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,733
Finds out?

766
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,431
Not that he will.

767
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:33,911
I mean, I won't say anything.

768
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,173
No.

769
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,089
But I tell you what.

770
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:40,221
A little bit of hush money

771
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,745
might just put both
of our minds at ease.

772
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,813
Why are you shutting the doors?

773
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,858
You know what I used to
do for my brother, right?

774
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:12,253
My job.

775
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,516
Yeah, of course. Everyone knew.

776
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,563
But you don't do that anymore.

777
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:24,178
Well, Kippy, you're not
giving me much of a choice.

778
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,974
Oh, fuck.

779
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:43,763
It's the Reebers.

780
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:45,069
Marvin?

781
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,942
Don't open that door.

782
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:55,775
Please. I love this life.

783
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:01,041
Hiding ain't living.

784
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,396
- Morning, Marvin!
- Oh, morning, Marvin!

785
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,760
- Chet, Sherry, good morning.
- Hi. -CHET: Oh, my goodness.

786
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,661
What happened to your hand there, buddy?
-

787
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,663
Uh, I'm fine. Bike accident.

788
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:16,361
Have you made a decision?

789
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:17,753
Well, we thought
about it, and...

790
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:19,451
- Here, hold my hand.
- Of course.

791
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:23,803
We want this home from you!

792
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,110
- Living room.
- Living room. Okay, great.

793
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,506
Oh. Every time.
It's so welcoming.

794
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,117
"[playing quietly]

795
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:37,773
Marv.

796
00:50:37,817 --> 00:50:38,861
It's me.

797
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,472
Yeah, I know. Uh, where are you?

798
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,169
What is going on? Are you okay?

799
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:43,475
I'm fine. Listen.

800
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,781
Um, did you, did
you get my message?

801
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,174
No. Why?

802
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:50,699
Um, I just... I quit, is all.

803
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,266
Again?

804
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,765
- I'm not happy.
- Marvin, look. It's you!

805
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,791
I need a change, Marv.

806
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,184
Can you quit later?

807
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:58,620
I need you to
bring me the papers

808
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,405
to the Emerald Springs house.

809
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:02,972
R-Right now?

810
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:05,540
Yes, right now.

811
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:08,195
The Reebers are here,
and they want to buy.

812
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,284
Yeah. Um, I just...

813
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:13,592
I don't think that I should.

814
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,682
Ashley, it's important.

815
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:21,382
Fine. Fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

816
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:23,254
Fine, fine, fine, fuck, fuck.

817
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:26,257
- Where is he?
- Shit!

818
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:29,564
Chet?

819
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:38,704
Are these the new
energy efficient models?

820
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,272
Uh...

821
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,231
Yes.

822
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:45,885
Aren't they great?

823
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:46,992
They're gorgeous.
They're perfect.

824
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:48,017
You know what?

825
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,758
I'm just not sold on this chair.

826
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:51,238
I found your brother.

827
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:52,587
Is Rose with him?

828
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,459
I don't know. I'm on my way.

829
00:51:54,502 --> 00:51:56,635
Be as hard on him
as you need to be,

830
00:51:56,678 --> 00:51:58,202
but I want them both alive.

831
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,947
I... I need you to stay.

832
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,472
Forever.

833
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:10,866
If it were that easy.

834
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:14,696
Please. Stay here with me.

835
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,264
I know that out there
is all the-the death

836
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,397
and the killing that
you write about,

837
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,314
but in here, you can be
who I know you really are.

838
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:24,967
And we can be whatever
we want to be.

839
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:27,274
We-we... we can be
poets, we can be artists,

840
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:28,754
we can be creators.

841
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:33,802
I don't have a choice.

842
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:35,891
Fine, neither do I.

843
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:38,285
So I am...

844
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:41,158
I'm coming with you.
Hold... Stop walking fast.

845
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,637
What do you want?

846
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:44,204
Hey, boss. How you doing?

847
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:45,684
Just get back to LKP.

848
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,009
I need someone there
when The Raven shows up.

849
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,556
He found Marvin and maybe Rose.

850
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,862
Okay, okay.

851
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,255
Why don't I just call The Raven,

852
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:52,618
and I'll get the
details myself...

853
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:54,083
Did I fucking stutter?!

854
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:56,260
The Raven already did your job.

855
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,087
But listen...

856
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,267
Hey!

857
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,746
Back away from the car!

858
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,705
That's my car!

859
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:10,099
Who's this?

860
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:11,797
It's Kippy!

861
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,930
Kippy! What the fuck
is going on, man?!

862
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:17,150
I know where the
bloodthirsty bitch is.

863
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,457
They are both in
Emerald Springs.

864
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,806
Thank you.

865
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:22,721
I got to get the
fuck out of here.

866
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,593
Ah, fuck!

867
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,815
Marvin motherfucking Gable.

868
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,686
Goddamn.

869
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:34,298
Talk to me, man.

870
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:36,430
Honey, where's my money?

871
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:38,824
Well, well, well, Rose.

872
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:40,869
My funny valentine.

873
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,568
You get my message, you
stupid piece of shit?

874
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,004
Spell it out clear
enough for you?

875
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:46,527
Nice detective work.

876
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:48,399
I didn't know you
understood Russian.

877
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,792
Let me ask you this
one question, though.

878
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:54,187
Do you want your fucking money?

879
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,362
Hmm?

880
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:57,103
Come to LKP.

881
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:59,366
Come if you dare, bitch.

882
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,368
<i>I just need a moment to think.</i>

883
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,761
As soon as Ashley gets here,

884
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:04,719
I'll get you
squared before I go.

885
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:06,286
<i>- Rose.</i>
- Go?

886
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,853
Wait, wait. Where
are you going, Marv?

887
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,637
<i>What are you doing?</i>

888
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,465
- A vacation.
<i>- I've got to help Rose.</i>

889
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,554
A long vacation.
-SHERRY: You're running away, Marv?

890
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:15,034
- <i>Can I?</i>
- Don't leave us.

891
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:17,123
- We need you.
- Excuse me.

892
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,298
Where are you...?

893
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:34,271
Rose! Rose!

894
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,852
Everything okay, Marv?

895
00:54:50,896 --> 00:54:53,159
Should we come back later or...?

896
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,205
No.

897
00:54:58,164 --> 00:54:59,818
I want this home for you.

898
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:08,130
<i>Marv, you better follow me.</i>

899
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:11,046
- What we doing, boss?
- Forget about cleaning up, man.

900
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,221
Rose never showed.

901
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:17,139
Raven, on the other hand, that
motherfucker is flying his ass

902
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,664
all the way to Emerald
Springs to pick up Gable.

903
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:22,231
Now, I need you to beat
him there and kill Gable.

904
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,297
All right, and if Raven gets in
the way, kill him, too, okay?

905
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,776
Guy's a fucking weirdo.
I don't trust him.

906
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,280
What if Rose is with him?

907
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,084
- She's not gonna be.
- And what about Kippy?

908
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,589
She's not, all right?
Gentlemen, listen, listen.

909
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:34,243
It's time we tie up
loose ends... yeah?

910
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,637
We fuck off and we rebuild.

911
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:38,160
Raven and Gable?

912
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,033
How the fuck are
we gonna do that?

913
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:43,557
Firepower, man.

914
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:46,647
Lots and lots of
fucking firepower.

915
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,090
That'll be Ashley with the...

916
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:57,702
...paperwork.

917
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:04,578
Marv, really sorry.

918
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:07,146
It's just, your brother
wants to talk to you.

919
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:10,758
Um, he won't hurt you

920
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:14,414
as long as you come quietly.

921
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:18,244
And remember what we
talked about, Roger.

922
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:20,028
Roger?

923
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,858
Stop being scary.

924
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,867
- Oh.
- Oh.

925
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,696
- Well, hi.
- Hello.

926
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,176
Who's this?

927
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,659
This is, uh, an old colleague.

928
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:43,269
More of a rival, really.

929
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:45,097
A ri... a rival?

930
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,316
Wow, that's exciting.

931
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,927
Ashley, why don't
you take the Reebers

932
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,320
into the kitchen
and get started.

933
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:52,713
No.

934
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,498
It's okay.

935
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:58,676
Great.

936
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,069
Let's go to the kitchen.

937
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:02,854
Come on. Let's. This way.

938
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,421
Oh.

939
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,684
Come along.

940
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:10,949
Hello again, Mr. Gable.

941
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:27,400
Hey, it's Cindy.

942
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,663
Leave a message.

943
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:32,710
Hey, baby, it's me. Um...

944
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:34,799
King and I, we're about
to do something very dumb,

945
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:37,758
and I just wanted to call
you just in case, um,

946
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:40,413
you know, whatever.

947
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,373
Anyways, um, sorry
if I've been...

948
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,552
...aloof and
emotionally unavailable.

949
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:52,207
You deserve better.

950
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,383
I will be better, and I...

951
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,169
I belong by your side.

952
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:59,084
I just need to kill some people.

953
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:02,130
It's work. It's-it's work.

954
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,349
Miss you.

955
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:05,438
And that's all I wanted to say.

956
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:08,485
Thanks. Yeah.

957
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:12,053
That was lame.

958
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,707
Nah, bruh, that shit was real.

959
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,666
I'm proud of you, blood.

960
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,936
Why'd you park so far away?
-What?

961
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:26,914
I'll tell you what, that sunken
living room is a game changer.

962
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,896
Imagine the parties. Ooh-ooh!

963
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,332
Right?

964
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:32,073
- See you later.
- What the fuck?

965
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,703
You like walking around a
residential area with your...

966
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:35,313
- with fucking guns?
- Look, I just wanted

967
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,657
to stretch my legs a little bit.
-

968
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:40,342
Where is Rose Carlisle?

969
00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:42,127
Gone.

970
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,564
- That's too bad.
- You read all this, right?

971
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:52,920
Okay.

972
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:54,356
Let's-let's discuss this later.

973
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,464
Let's Swiss-cheese
these motherfuckers.

974
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,142
I think the time has come.

975
00:58:57,185 --> 00:58:58,491
To duck!

976
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:02,843
Whoo!

977
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,195
These guys work for Merlo!

978
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:08,588
They will kill us all!

979
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,024
So, same team?

980
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:13,027
Hmm.

981
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:17,510
Hello?

982
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,425
Go!

983
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:22,863
We brought firepower!

984
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,889
Marvin Gable, where
the fuck you at?

985
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:30,262
You take the fanny pack guy.

986
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:31,611
We don't want to hurt anyone.

987
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,004
We're just here to talk.

988
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:35,746
Huh? Where the fuck... Oh.

989
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,340
Feathers? Really?

990
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,790
Gable, bring your scary ass
from up over there, baby.

991
01:00:25,317 --> 01:00:27,145
Man, who the fuck are you?

992
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:29,451
I'm a black belt, motherfucker.

993
01:00:29,495 --> 01:00:31,366
Hey!

994
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:35,066
- Jeff?
- Marv.

995
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:37,546
Congratulations on the Regional
Realtor of the Year Award.

996
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,547
I was showing the
house next door.

997
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,332
Looked like you needed help.

998
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,029
- But they got guns.
- I know.

999
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,647
Sounds like a reload.

1000
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,736
- You go low, I go high.
- No, Jeff!

1001
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:54,607
No!

1002
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,613
That was my bullet.

1003
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,243
- No, that's my bullet.
- No, it was mine.

1004
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:03,548
- No, that's my bullet.
- It was mine.

1005
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:05,400
- No, it was actually...
- Gable!

1006
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,707
- Get that little motherfucker!
- Oh!

1007
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:10,536
Damn!

1008
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:12,799
Oh. Fucking psycho!

1009
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:25,203
Bitch-ass Raven. Beastmode!

1010
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,554
Here, take that.

1011
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:30,437
- You guys...
- I need to find something sharp.

1012
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:32,950
What the hell is going on?

1013
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:35,343
Uh, everything's fine.

1014
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:38,695
- Marv.
- No, no, no, no.

1015
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,479
Chet, Sherry, how
are you holding up?

1016
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:41,522
Not good, Marv.

1017
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,232
Get on your fucking feet, Raven.

1018
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:55,842
You're on the menu.

1019
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:58,758
- Bon appétit.
- Fuck yeah.

1020
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,025
I'm so sorry about this.

1021
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:07,158
I'll get these guys out
of here as soon as I can

1022
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:08,725
and get right back
to your paperwork.

1023
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,727
Come on!

1024
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,119
Think you're fucking invincible?

1025
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,860
Who you think you
are, you fucking...

1026
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,533
Yeah, you little
feather-throwing motherfucker.

1027
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:16,907
I'm on your shit, boy.

1028
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,647
Oh, shit!

1029
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,606
Bitch, is you crazy?

1030
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,875
St-Stop it!

1031
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:41,453
Stay here and don't come
out until I come get you.

1032
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:42,604
- Please.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1033
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,456
Marv, Marv.

1034
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:46,110
And don't worry.

1035
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:48,193
I've got guys who can patch
all of this up like new.

1036
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:51,593
What?

1037
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:57,425
Oh, Ashley. Are you okay?

1038
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:13,964
MARVIN and THE RAVEN: Sorry.

1039
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:16,705
Stop!

1040
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:19,317
Stop it! Stop it, you two! Stop!

1041
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:35,376
Stop! Stop, stop!

1042
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,771
Marv, please don't kill him.

1043
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,730
Ash, he's a bad man.

1044
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,123
Stop! Bad?

1045
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,604
For fuck's sake,
well, what are you?

1046
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:47,562
What-what are any of us?

1047
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:52,916
You told me to find something
that I love and to go after it.

1048
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:56,484
And I have.

1049
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:58,399
And it's him.

1050
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,683
<i>I should listen
to my own advice.</i>

1051
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,222
<i>Zaks, thank you.</i>

1052
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,552
Merlo?

1053
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:51,382
Where's my goddamn money?

1054
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:53,819
Rose.

1055
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:01,566
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.

1056
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:04,264
My fucking valentine.

1057
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,187
You know, for a ghost,

1058
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,885
you sure have been
stirring up some shit.

1059
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:19,009
Only took a few swings to
knock the truth out of him.

1060
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:25,024
You think you can play me? Steal my money?
-

1061
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,592
She knows everything, boss.
But I was gonna stop her.

1062
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,550
Shut the fuck up!

1063
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:32,118
You're already a dead man.

1064
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:34,860
- Yes, sir.
- You, Merlo and Kippy.

1065
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,515
So, what was the plan?

1066
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:38,951
- Start over?
- Mm.

1067
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,040
It doesn't work that way, Rosie.

1068
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,782
You steal from me, you die.

1069
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:03,584
Boss, listen, she's got
access to all the accounts.

1070
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:11,201
Welcome home, Marv.

1071
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,291
Want a boba?

1072
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,773
Look at you, Marv.
You're a mess.

1073
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:21,385
See, this is what happens
when you go off on your own.

1074
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,694
I knew you'd come.

1075
01:07:26,738 --> 01:07:28,392
I need you, Marv.

1076
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:32,396
I need all of you.

1077
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:36,965
The good, the bad,
the everything.

1078
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:40,230
Knight in fucking shining
armor, aren't you, brother?

1079
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,182
There he is.

1080
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:22,446
My monster.

1081
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:27,233
Cut him down. Everyone.

1082
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,377

you've never beaten
me in a fight.

1129
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,448
Not once.

1130
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:04,885
And after you lose today,

1131
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,845
this will again be your home.

1132
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:14,808
Like my hat?

1133
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:49,060
Cliff seemed like a good guy.

1134
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:54,021
But he was never your brother.

1135
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:55,632
I'm your brother.

1136
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:57,155
Brother?

1137
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,636
No brother would
use me like you did.

1138
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,615
We're a team.

1139
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:07,225
I hate seeing you
like this, Marv.

1140
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:08,792
You belong with me now.

1141
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:09,967
With you?

1142
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,365
Never again.

1143
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:05,152
All you had to do was kill Rose.

1144
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:29,437
Goodbye, Alvin.

1145
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,542
Rose, it's me.

1146
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,991
Merlo was right.

1147
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,470
I do know everything.

1148
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:03,602
Huh?

1149
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:10,696
What did you do?

1150
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:14,657
Well, I hand-delivered

1151
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:19,009
one last special
Valentine's Day card.

1152
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:23,187
Along with a small gift.

1153
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:27,017
<i>A finger.</i>

1154
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,890
More specifically, a fingerprint

1155
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:34,720
belonging to our favorite
Kiwi pal and accountant...

1156
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:39,725
...granting access to
your personal finances.

1157
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:43,860
Which is proof
you've been skimming

1158
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:48,081
from our oh-so-serious
Russki suppliers for years.

1159
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:51,258
<i>- Za zdorovie.
- Za zdorovie.</i>

1160
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:54,697
I was able to broker a
pretty lucrative deal.

1161
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,916
Great plan, right?

1162
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,440
My finder's fee.

1163
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:00,964
Do you have any
idea what you've...

1164
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:28,121
Marvin. Marvin!

1165
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:30,210
Brother, please.

1166
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,343
Don't let Rose ruin everything.

1167
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:34,911
Happy Valentine's, dickhead.

1168
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,616
Rose! Rose!

1169
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,139
- Please wait.
- We did it, Marv.

1170
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:48,489
Now go back to the
life you love so much.

1171
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:52,755
Rose, there's something
I have to tell you.

1172
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:54,757
What? What do you
need to tell me?

1173
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:56,933
I love you.

1174
01:17:56,976 --> 01:17:59,457
I always have.

1175
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,330
Well, say it again.

1176
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:05,724
Make me believe it.

1177
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,610
<i>It's like I said.</i>

1178
01:18:22,654 --> 01:18:25,570
<i>Valentine's Day is filled
with the unexpected.</i>

1179
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:28,965
You're dangerous.

1180
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:33,447
<i>Whether it's finding new love...</i>

1181
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:35,798
What's Cindy want?

1182
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:37,147
It worked.

1183
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:42,369
<i>...or the opportunity
for second chances...</i>

1184
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:44,284
I told you, motherfucker.

1185
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:46,852
